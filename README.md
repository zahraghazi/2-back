# 2-back

Introduction
The n-back task is a continuous performance task used to assess a part of working memory. In this task, participants are presented with a sequence of stimuli (e.g., letters, numbers, shapes) and must indicate when the current stimulus matches the one from n steps earlier in the sequence. The "n" in n-back refers to how many steps back in the sequence the participant needs to remember. For example, in a 2-back task, participants must compare the current stimulus to the one presented two steps earlier. The n-back task can be adjusted to various levels of difficulty by changing the value of n, making it a versatile tool for evaluating working memory performance.

How it works
This task involves a 2-back test with four conditions: digit, color, shape, and face. Following this, there will be a music session. Afterwards, the 2-back test will be administered again to assess the impact of relaxation music on working memory.
